      Since 2015, AELF and Presidio Aircraft Leasing have together successfully completed over 100 transactions. Our deal strategy is to acquire and lease mid-life assets that we know and understand with our own equity. Our target assets are those that may require more active management throughout the transition process or significant technical expertise â€“ this is where we can truly add value. Aircraft and engine acquisitions are achieved through a variety of channels, including airlines, OEMs, other leasing companies and asset managers.
